# 🙌 Welcome to Free-Hit

+ As we all prefer open-source softwares for our daily use, it can be difficult to find tools that are specific to our needs. This is where  **Free-Hit** comes in.
+ Free-Hit is a tool used to search for open-source projects that are both free and helpful for our needs
+ Although Free-Hit is a powerful tool to search for open-source projects, we recognize that it is still evolving. It will take time for us to add all the projects,resources and additional content that our users want. 
+ That's why, we encourage contributions from everyone interested in making Free-Hit even more attractive and useful.

# 🚀 About
+ If you're a developer or a tech enthusiast, you can help us create a better experience for everyone.
+ Free-Hit is more than just a tool to find open-source apps. It's also a treasure of useful content that can help you in many ways. 
+ For example, we have curated a list of remote hiring websites that can help you find your dream job from the comfort of your home. 
+ But that's not all – we have big plans for the future. We are working hard to add more useful content that can make your life easier and more productive. 
+ Stay tuned for updates!
